README

1. An executable is provided. If needed, create a new executable of the "Dancing I" program by executing 'make' in the same folder as main.c.

2. Run the executable in one of two ways:
	a. Execute './barril1_mp1 <dancing> <outlines>' where dancing and outlines 	are either 0 or 1.
	b. Execute './barril1_mp1'. This runs the program with the default values of 	dancing = 1 and outlines = 0.

Note: You may exit the program by hitting the ESC button.
